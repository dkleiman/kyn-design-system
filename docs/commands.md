My grandfather always said: "Son, if you're going to do something more than twice, then you should probably automate that task." With that piece of advice in mind, the following script creates a new component:

```text
npm run generate path/to/ComponentName
```

And if you would prefer a function style component:

```text
npm run generate path/to/ComponentName -- --type function
```
